If you choose to create your IAM Account using Slack, before being asked your to connect to your Slack account, you might be asked for your workspace name. If that's the case, use `granmagroupe` as workspace name. Then you can proceed to the next step.

Step 2. A form will appear, here you are asked to give your `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `username` and `password`. Also, you'll notice a `note` field. You have to fill it in, admins will see it and it helps them know who you are and why they should confirm your account. Upon submitting the form, a message will appear confirming that you applied for an account.
