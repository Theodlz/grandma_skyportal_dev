If you choose to create your IAM Account using Slack, before being asked your to connect to your Slack account, you might be asked for your workspace name. If that's the case, use `granmagroupe` as workspace name. Then you can proceed to the next step.

Step 2. A form will appear, here you are asked to give your `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `username` and `password`. Also, you'll notice a `note` field. We request you to put your affiliation in this note, as well as other information you may find useful. It is mandatory ! Upon submitting the form, a message will appear confirming that you applied for an account.
