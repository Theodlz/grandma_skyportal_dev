## Creating your IAM Account and login to SkyPortal

Step 2. Now that you are on IAM's login page, choose the method of your choice: Google or EDUGain. Soon, you'll also be able to login with a normal IAM account, not necessarily through Google or EDUGain. That feature actually already works, but was deactivated for testing purposes. It will be reactivated if some users to not have access to either Google or EDUGain. Please contact us if that's the case !

Step 3. A form will appear, here you are asked to give your `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `username` and `password`. Also, you'll notice a `note` field. You have to fill it in, admins will see it and it helps them know who you are and why they should confirm your account. Upon submitting the form, a message will appear confirming that you applied for an account.

Step 4. Now, you will be informed that you received an email with a confirmation link. **DO NOT** click it. It is not necessary, you can just ignore it as an admin will confirm your account later.
When your account is confirmed, you will receive and email with a link to set your password.
This password is the password of your IAM Account. If you created your IAM Account using your Google or EDUGain account, you will not need it later on. When the option to login directly with your IAM Account (not through Google or EDUGain) will be added, this is the password you can use if you prefer that option.
